# Nifty vs Alternatives

The choice of core NFT protocol matters. It lays the foundations for future ecosystem and needs to be free and fair for all. Commercialisation at the lowest protocol levels (like the Metadata standard) introduces unnecessary friction to the system and undermines the key principles of decentralization in web3.

Even though Nifty is not the only Metadata standard in the Solana space, we believe it is the way forward for NFTs, enabling a more open and fair Solana and also a solid technological investment for any project contemplating alternatives.

It is not down to any developer but to the community to decide which solutions are most appropriate for their usecase.

To table below helps to visualise the alternatives, enabling safe and educated Metadata choices.
